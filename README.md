# Global Market Sales Data Analysis

This dataset contains information on global market sales across various products.
The project calculates the average profit for three fields:segment, category, and value.
 A table is generated showing the average profit, 
with the highest profit observed in the technology sector.
 To ensure accuracy, columns are placed within brackets, and market is expanded as a subset of category.
 A heatmap graph is created using the seaborn library, with indices considered as two fields and one field for columns.
The visualization can also be normalized as an alternative to using seaborn.
